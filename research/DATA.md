Annual Subsurface Drainage Map (Red River of the North Basin; Cho et al., 2019)

This resource is a repository of the annual subsurface drainage (so-called "Tile Drainage") maps for the Bois de Sioux Watershed (BdSW), Minnesota and the Red River of the North Basin (RRB), separately. The RRB maps cover a 101,500 km2 area in the United States, which overlies portions of North Dakota, South Daokta, and Minnesota. The maps provide annual subsurface drainage system maps for recent four years, 2009, 2011, 2014, and 2017 (In 2017, the subsurface drainage maps including the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar as an additional input are also provided). Please see Cho et al. (2019) in Water Resources Research (WRR) for full details.

Map Metadata (Proj=longlat +datum=WGS84)
Raster value key:
0 = NoData, masked by non-agricultural areas (e.g. urban, water, forest, or wetland land) and high gradient cultivated crop areas (slope > 2%) based on the USGS National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) and the USGS National Elevation Dataset
1 = Undrained (UD)
2 = Subsurface Drained (SD)
