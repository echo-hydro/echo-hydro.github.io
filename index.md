<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #2a2eba;">Welcome! </span></b> <span style="font-size: 16px !important;"> I am a hydrologist who focuses on accurate and timely estimations and predictions of critical hydrologic fluxes, storages, and processes for enhanced water resources management, flood prediction, and infrastructure design. For this, I use field observations, multiple remote sensing techniques (active and passive microwave, infrared, thermal, and gamma radiation) via UAV, aircraft, and satellite platforms, and climate and hydrological model simulations along with big-data analytics. 
I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar working with <a href="https://ceps.unh.edu/person/jennifer-jacobs">Dr. Jennifer Jacobs</a> in Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering & Earth Systems Research Center, Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space (EOS), at University of New Hampshire, Durham, New Hampshire, U.S. If you have any questions/suggestions, feel free to reach out to me. Thanks! </span>
