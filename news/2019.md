<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #BD0026;">July 2019 </span>

<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;"><span style="color: #1c9099;">Jiwon Jeon, Mijin Kim, Suhye Kim</span> successfully completed CNIR/GBME summer internship program at the cocoanlab.</span></b>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">They worked on the "cognitive map" project. The activity they did: Literature review (they are now cognitive map experts!), code implementation (see [hex_glm1.m](https://github.com/cocoanlab/cocoanCORE/blob/master/Misc_utilities/hex_glm1.m) and [hex_glm2.m](https://github.com/cocoanlab/cocoanCORE/blob/master/Misc_utilities/hex_glm2.m)), and fMRI data analysis using the code. I enjoyed the last four weeks with them. Jiwon and Suhye decided to spend one more month in our lab.</span>

<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;"><span style="color: #1c9099;">Soo Ahn</span> successfully completed her first experiment on Pleasure and Pain.</span></b>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">Soo Ahn finished her last scan after 15 months she started the project. We asked about her feelings. Sungwoo will start his experiment soon, which will be one-year long experiment. We asked for a word from him.</span>

<img src="/news/images/ohbm2019.jpg" width="700" align="center" hspace="20" />

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">Suhwan gave a poster presentation on "Understanding the neural mechanisms of temporal dynamics of integrating prediction into pain perception", and Lada gave a poster presentation on "Interpreting machine learning models in neuroimaging: a unified framework." We look forward to posting our work on a preprint server soon. Stay tuned!</span>

<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;">Wani's paper, “Cognitive self-regulation influences pain-related physiology,” has been accepted to _PAIN_ and chosen as an Editor's Choice article</span></b>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">In the paper, we developed physiological markers for pain and found that cognitive self-regulation of pain operates on the level of autonomic nervous system, producing physiologically meaningful changes. This work is done in collaboration with Gordon, a postbac RA in Tor's lab, and under a supervision of Tor. Below, you can find a video abstract. You can see the most recent version of the paper (for free) [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/361519v2), and an old twitter [thread](https://twitter.com/choongwanwoo/statuses/1015173555984654337) where I provided a high-level summary of the paper. Data and code is available [here](https://github.com/canlab/cognitive_regulation_physiology). </span>

<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;">Yongwook's paper, “False-positive neuroimaging: Undisclosed flexibility in testing spatial hypotheses allows presenting anything as a replicated finding”, has been accepted to _NeuroImage_</span></b>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">In the paper, we implemented a Bayes factor calculator for the Bayesian MANOVA using the BRMS package in R and made a <a href="http://cocoanlab.skku.edu/bayes_factor_bayesian_manova/">website</a> to provide a web-based service of the analysis. Check out the <a href="/pdfs/Hong2019_NeuroImage.pdf">paper</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cocoanlab/falsepositiveneuroimaging">code</a>.</span>

<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;">Lab Photo for 2019 </span></b>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">We will take a lab photo every year on the first day of lab meeting of the spring semester (in South Korea, the spring semester starts at March).</span>

<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;">National Research Foundation of Korea selected us to support our research for the next four years (2019-2022) </span></b>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">Our lab will be supported by the Basic Science Research Program for early career researchers through the National Research Foundation of Korea (한국연구재단) for the next four years. The research grant will support us to develop and validate fMRI-based pain biomarkers using 3T and 7T MRI and machine learning.</span>
