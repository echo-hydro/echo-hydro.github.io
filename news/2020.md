<span style="font-size: 18px !important; color: #07153D;">The <a href="https://snow.nasa.gov/campaigns/snowex/2023/overview">2023 NASA SnowEx October campaign</a> took place in the tundra and boreal forest regions of Alaska from 19 - 29 October! It was such a collaborative campaign with amazing students, postdocs, local researchers, and colleagues. Thanks all! </span>

<span style="font-size: 18px !important; color: #07153D;">At <a href="https://www.slf.ch/en/about-the-slf/events-and-courses/international-symposium-on-snow-2022/">International Symposium on Snow 2022</a>, I presented my research regarding <a href="https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/activities/snowpex">SnowPEx+</a> project working with ECCC colleagues <b>"SnowPEx+: Global Gridded SWE Product Evaluation using Airborne Gamma Radiation and Snow Course Transect Datasets"</b> on 25-30 September! It was great time to meet many friends and colleagues in-person in the beautiful town. The International Glaciological Society and the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF jointly organized this symposium. The symposium held at the Davos Congress Centre, Davos, Switzerland on 25-30 September 2022.</span>

<span style="font-size: 18px !important; color: #07153D;">Dr. Jacobs gave an invited talk about my recent work at <a href="https://www.nhcaw.org/2021-nh-coastal-climate-summit/">2021 Coastal New Hampshire Climate Summit</a>! The NH Climate Summit took place on May 26-27. Over 130 participants attended the Summit, including municipal staff and volunteers from across the coastal NH watershed, technical assistance providers, state and federal agency staff, researchers, and other interested community members and partners. Check out the <a href="https://www.nhcaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jacobs-Climate-Summit-052721.pdf"><b>full slide</b></a>, and see the recorded <a href="https://www.nhcaw.org/2021-nh-coastal-climate-summit/"><b>video</b></a> from Day2 2:28:28. </span>

<span style="font-size: 18px !important; color: #07153D;">I'm so honored that my recent WRR paper is being recognized as a recipient of the <b>2019 WRR Editors' Choice Award</b>! I've heard this news from Dr. Martyn Clark, Editor-in-Chief of Water Resources Research, that "Please accept my hearty congratulations on behalf of the editors of WRR. Your work was highlighted at the Hydrology Section business meeting at the 2020 AGU Fall meeting this week!"</span>
 
<i>Starting in 2011 Water Resources Research has instituted the Editor's Choice Awards. Editors’ Choice Award are given to about 1% of published articles in any calendar year to provide professional recognition to scientists for their outstanding work. The selection is made by the Editors of WRR based on technical significance, novelty, originality, presentation, and broader implications of the publication.</i>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #BD0026;">Oct 2020 </span>

<span style="font-size: 18px !important; color: #07153D;">I presented my recent work about extreme snow-related events at the <a href="https://theicnet.org/">Infrastructure & Climate Network (ICNet)</a> Global Graduate and Student network webinar on 16th October! I was invited by the ICNet Global Graduate and Student network leadership as a first presenter for the 2020 ICNet webinar series. The presentation title is <b><i>"Design Extreme Snowpack and Snowmelt for Infrastructure Design over the U.S.". </i></b> In this talk, I discussed about current and future extreme snowpack and snowmelt (with rain-on-snow events) over the North America. If you would like to see the full presentation, click <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gp9a22pPxf4ZsnOSv4fwtkAx0r8YcaYq/view?usp=sharing"><b>here</b></a>. The Infrastructure & Climate Network (ICNet) is a network of over 60 academics, students, and practitioners who are dedicated to accelerating climate science and engineering research in the Northeastern United States. The ICNet focuses on climate change and sea level rise impacts and adaptation for sustainable bridges, roads, and transportation networks with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF). Thanks again the ICNet Global Student leadership! Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions/feedback. </span>

<span style="font-size: 18px !important; color: #07153D;">I'm super exciting to see that our recent work published in <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020WR028126">Water Resources Research</a> with my advisor, Dr. Jennifer Jacobs, for infrastructure design to withstand snowmelt flooding was featured in <a href="https://eos.org/articles/how-infrastructure-standards-miss-the-mark-on-snowmelt">AGU EOS Science News <b>"How Infrastructure Standards Miss the Mark on Snowmelt"</b></a> on 16th October, 2020! Check it out!
 
<span style="font-size: 16px !important; color: #3759BD; "><i>In the article, "Knowing the hazards posed by snowmelt-driven floods, Cho and Jacobs analyzed snow water equivalent (a measure of the amount of water contained in snowpack) and snowmelt data across the continental United States"... "Cho is working on that problem and currently trying to determine how climate change will influence their values. “Based on this climate issue, the standard values should be updated regularly in the future to provide the most robust guidance for engineering or water resource management”.</i></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #BD0026;">Sep 2020 </span>

<span style="font-size: 18px !important; color: #07153D;">I presented my Sierra Nevada snowpack work at the <a href="https://above.nasa.gov/SnowEx/2020_agenda.html">NASA Terrastrial Hydrology Program Snow Virtual meeting</a> on 14th Sepember, 2020! I also served as a moderator of the Prairie snow group for the breakout discussion. It was great time to hear and discuss various opinions and thoughts about the gaps/opportunities for prairie snow research from operational and science perspectives. More than 80 snow scientists and hydrologists attended this meeting. My presentation title is <b><i>"How different are the Sierra Nevada snowpack estimates from four land surface models with three forcing datasets?". </i></b> Click <a href="https://above.nasa.gov/files/snowex_2020/Cho_Day2_poster_879.pdf"><b>here</b></a> for the full slides.

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #BD0026;">June 2020 </span>

<span style="font-size: 18px !important; color: #07153D;">I presented my recent research at <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/sinter/">Snow International (SINTER)</a> online meeting on 5th June! I was invited by SINTER Executive Team (Chair: <a href="https://profils-profiles.science.gc.ca/en/profile/chris-derksen">Chris Derksen</a>) as a presenter at the first SINTER online meeting. As an early career scientist, it was such a honor, and great opportunity to share my research with the international snow science community. More than 60 scientists and hydrologists attended the meeting. The presentation title is <b><i>"The rediscovery of the value of 40-years airborne gamma radiation SWE". </i></b> Click <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rU1wmFiOT1Ddt2UZAEkesJSIOrx2Zo3F/view?usp=sharing"><b>here</b></a> if you want to take a look at the full slides. SINTER (formerly i-SWGR) is an international collective of scientists with interest in remote sensing of snow, supported by ground-based observations, physical modeling, and data assimilation. SINTER operates distinctly from other community-wide efforts which aim to coordinate progress on snow science, such as the NASA Terrestrial Hydrology Program, monthly NASA SnowEx online meetings, Global Cryosphere Watch Snow Watch working group, etc. Thanks again the SINTER Executive Team! Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions/feedback. </span>
